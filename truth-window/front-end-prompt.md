## First prompt
I am building an educational demo which will show off how to use Containers in a Cloudflare project. 
I have a working demo already, I just need the frontend.
The Python server is available in container_src/server.py. 
And you can imagine the front-end can hit that directyl /exec and /session. 
Also you'll see there is a websocket connection. I'd like to build two separate pages. 
One for the HTTPS version and One for the websocket interation. 
This is for showing off a Python REPL. 

Can you help me build out a very simple tailwind based front end that hits those endpoints?

You can remove any current styling and go for your own.
